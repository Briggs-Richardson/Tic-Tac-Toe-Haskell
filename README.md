# Tic-Tac-Toe-Haskell

Console Tic Tac Toe Game against a computer AI written in Haskell!

![](Tic-Tac-Toe.gif)

Apparently I'm a very lousy tic tac toe player. Perhaps you could do better... However, 
if you mean to win the game, then I recommend avoiding impossible mode. It is IMPOSSIBLE 
to beat!

The computer AI utilizes the minimax algorithm. In impossible mode, the computer thinks 
8 moves ahead. Since it goes second, it is evaluating every possible terminal game state
and decides the best move.

### How to run it

In order to run the program, you're going to need either the haskell interpreter or compiler

I prefer the haskell interpreter, ghci. As shown in the above gif, you can run the program as follows

ghci Main.hs <br />
*Main > main
