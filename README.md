# Tic-Tac-Toe-Haskell

Console Tic Tac Toe Game against a computer AI written in Haskell!

![](Tic-Tac-Toe.gif)

Apparently I'm a very lousy tic tac toe player. Perhaps you could do better... However, 
if you mean to win the game, then I recommend avoiding impossible mode. It is IMPOSSIBLE 
to beat!

The computer AI utilizes the minimax algorithm. In impossible mode, the computer thinks 
8 moves ahead. Since it goes second, it is evaluating every possible terminal game state
and decides the best move.

If there are any issues, please do let me know! Thanks!
